# 🏦 k8s-ai-banking-platform

A production-grade, Kubernetes-first, AI-powered banking platform built with FastAPI, React, PostgreSQL, Qdrant, and LLM-based intelligence.

This project simulates an enterprise-level digital banking system integrating Generative AI, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), CRM automation, transaction processing, and DevOps practices within a cloud-native microservices architecture.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

k8s-ai-banking-platform is an end-to-end AI-powered banking assistant designed to simulate real-world banking workflows including:

- Intelligent chatbot powered by LLM
- Complaint detection using sentiment analysis
- Fund transfer with compliance validation
- Sanctions checking via vector search (Qdrant)
- Admin management panel
- Transaction history tracking
- Kubernetes-based deployment
- Dockerized microservices
- CI/CD ready architecture

The system is designed to mimic enterprise BFSI production environments.

- Context-aware response generation
- Integrated RAG for compliance rules

### 📌 CRM Sub-Agent
- Detects complaints automatically
- Classifies severity & category using LLM
- Performs sentiment scoring
- Stores complaints in CRM table
- Notifies customer

### 💸 Fund Transfer Workflow
- Beneficiary selection
- Sanctions verification via vector search
- Balance validation
- Transfer limits validation
- Transaction logging
- Atomic debit operations

### 📜 Transaction History
- Fetch last N transactions
- Display formatted statements
- Persistent ledger storage

### 👤 Admin Panel
- Manage customer balances
- Credit/Debit via wallet API
- View beneficiaries
- Delete beneficiaries
- Upload sanctions/rules file
- Configure transfer limits

---

## 🧠 AI & RAG Implementation

- Compliance rules stored in Qdrant vector DB
- Semantic similarity search for sanctions check
- LLM-based structured output parsing
- CRM complaint detection using StructuredOutputParser

---

## 🗄️ Database Design

### PostgreSQL Tables:
- accounts
- beneficiaries
- transactions
- transfer_limits
- crm_complaints

### Vector Database:
- Qdrant collection for sanctions/rules

---

## 🐳 Containerization

All services are Dockerized:

- backend
- frontend
- postgres
- qdrant

Docker Compose for local development.

---

## ☸ Kubernetes Deployment

Deployed on local Kubernetes cluster using:

## ⭐ Why This Project Stands Out

This is not a basic chatbot.

It demonstrates:

- Generative AI integration
- Structured LLM outputs
- Vector database integration
- Microservices architecture
- Kubernetes deployment
- Banking domain logic
- Admin + Compliance workflows
- Production-level design 

---
